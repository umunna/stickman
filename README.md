# Stickman Game: Police & Thief
Created a python stickman game; the game has thief and police as designated characters.
The thief (user) takes coins and the police tries to get him caught.
If user not caught, the difficulty increases and the police gets faster.
i.e the more coins you take the faster the police gets.
Created using the tkinter libary.

Possible future updates; user specification prompt.
New conditions for new prompts.
formally introduce level prompts
